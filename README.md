php curl to submit safeway monopoly prize pieces

I was sick of those dang Monopoly prize pieces from Safeway, having to type each one in, so I wrote this PHP to submit the codes.

I scanned my codes into a CSV file using OCR and then uploaded the CSV using this tool.

You can log in to the site afterwards to print the PDF to attach the winning coupons to.

Feel free to modify as much as you need.
